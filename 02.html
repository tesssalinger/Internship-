                        <h2> 4th Day</h2>
                        <p> Today I worked on the Scorpri Video for Secondz. Another part of the BYO Campaign with blackhearts and sparrows.
                             This consistend of another editing brief and footage annotation. The editing briefs lets me creative freedom with how the video with turn out. 
                            Obviously since this series is for a client there was a design brief they pitched to them I had to follow and overall intention I had to stick to.

I also did the text graphic overlays for the Ini Coffee video and BYO with Lee Ho Fook. This was really fun to refine my illustratior and photoshop skills under professional requirements.</p>
