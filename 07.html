                <P> On this day, I started in making the editing brief and organizing the raw footage for Secondz BYO with Blackhearts and Sparrows Campaign. The editing brief consisted of creating a visual storyline sequence for the editors to follow, highlighting which footage and soundbites were useful, and specifying the design and rendering requirements for Instagram.</P>

                    My supervisor taught me a script that helps organise all footage files into a google sheet document quickly which makes going through and annotating them way easier!</p>
