                This is it. This is the start of this internship with PWR!
                <br><br>
                For the first week, there was little to focus on. This week's primary goals were to understand how the business works and just get used to the layout of the office. The biggest thing that occurred this week was PWR's 4th birthday stream, so my internship will probably start in one of the most hectic weeks of these four months. During the stream, I got to see a lot of what happens behind the scenes in such a large stream met a large portion of the talent at PWR.
                <br><br>
                Next week, we'll dive a bit deeper into marketing, as that's the focus of this internship!
